I'm a Postdoc research fellow at [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). My research interests include artificial intelligence, natural language processing, large language models, discourse parsing, dialogue systems, and summarization.

I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/). I also collaborate with [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html) to research LLMs.

You can find my CV here: [Feng Jiang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
