Education/PostDoc
======
* PostDoc in Computer Science and Technology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, 2024
* Ph.D in Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, 2022
* M.S. in Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, 2019

Work experience
======
* Summer 2018: Algorithm Engineer (Intern)
  * Microsoft 
  * Responsible for the research on the more natural conversation experience with dialogue act
  * As a key member in building a dialogue process description and control prototype system
  * The system contains four dimensions of contexts based on Dialogue Interpretation Theory (DIT++), leveraging dialog act and beliefs to make the robot more natural, politer, more active, and longer memory
  * Supervisor: Yue Pan
  
Research Project
======
* Research on discourse structure analysis driven by micro and macro nuclearity (NSFC)
* Fifth participant 
* Responsible for the research on the Chinese macro discourse resources construction and discourse analysis methods
* As the main member in constructing a representation schema of the Chinese macro discourse structure
* As one of the main leaders in the annotation of the Macro Chinese Discourse TreeBank (MCDTB)
* Proposed two discourse parsers based on global reverse reading and topic segmentation, according to the characteristics of Chinese macro discourse structure
* Proposed three neural models, which enhance the semantic representation of discourse units, indirectly and directly modeling discourse relations separately, to recognize implicit discourse relations

Competition
======
* [DSTC-12](https://sites.google.com/dstc.community/dstc-12/home)
    * Controllable Conversational Theme Detection Track (Top 2 Placement)
    * Theme detection is essential for analyzing conversations, especially in customer support, sales, and marketing domains. Automatically identifying and categorizing conversation themes greatly reduces the need for manual review of lengthy dialogues.
    * Served as the team leader, overseeing the overall research direction and implementation.
    * Proposed a preference-guided topic clustering algorithm that assigns utterances to topic groups based on user preferences at the cross-conversation level.
    * Developed a context-aware topic labeling method capable of generating coherent topic labels by considering contextual dependencies within a single conversation.


* [ICSR+InnoBiz 2024](https://www.asianlp.sg/conferences/icsr2024/web/)
    * GRASS Social Robotic Competition Award (TOP 2)
    * This task aims to propose the use of artificial intelligence to endow better human-computer interaction, especially considering sentiment and emotions.
    * As the leader of the team (collaborate with 1 postgraduate student and 1 undergraduate).
    * Proposed a human-machine hybrid data construction method and an error-invariant data enhancement method for the no-training dataset setup.
    * Provided an end-to-end digital human framework based on LLMs for emotion perception, cognition, expression, and reflection.
      
* [NLPCC Share Task 2023](http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2023/cfpt.php) 
    * Chinese Grammatical Error Correction track (TOP 3)
    * The task  aims to automatically correct grammatical errors that violate language rules and convert the noisy input texts to cleaned output texts. This task focuses on correcting grammatical errors made by native Chinese speakers.
    * As the leader of the team (collaborate with 1 postgraduate student).
    * Proposed a human-machine hybrid data construction method and an error-invariant data enhancement method for the no-training dataset setup.
    * Based on our Phoenix model,  we trained GrammarGPT to achieve better performance than the SOTA model, only using data of 1/1200.
      
 * [CAIL 2022](http://cail.cipsc.org.cn/task_summit.html?raceID=4&cail_tag=2022) (Challenge of AI in Law)
    * Summarization track (TOP 1, First Prize)
    * The task aims to generate a summary of law-related public opinion news with an average length of 1600 words.
    * As the leader of the team (collaborate with 1 postgraduate student).
    * Proposed a two-stage (extracted-generating) judicial summary model, including a Hi-XLNET to extract the summary of long documents and a T5 model to polish the summary.
  
Teaching
